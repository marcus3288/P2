            Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the hedges that
            shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild, amid
            the dense-packed trees of trackless forests and across wide and
            empty plains, rangers keep their unending watch.

            The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the
            civilized races and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast
            and ranger work as one to fight the monstrous foes that threaten
            civilization and the wilderness alike. Emulating the Beast Master
            archetype means committing yourself to this ideal, working in
            partnership with an animal as its companion and friend.
